 <h4> Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house
</h4>
<p>
    <h5 class="LORD_GORING"> LORD GORING.</h5> 
    <p class="speech">dressed in the height of fashion, _is lounging in an
    armchair_.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN is standing in front of the fireplace.
    He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress.
    As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room.</p>
    
    <h5 class="LORD_GORING"> LORD GORING. </h5> 
    <p class="speech"> My dear Robert, it’s a very awkward business, very awkward
    indeed.  You should have told your wife the whole thing.  Secrets from
    other people’s wives are a necessary luxury in modern life.  So, at
    least, I am always told at the club by people who are bald enough to know
    better.  But no man should have a secret from his own wife.  She
    invariably finds it out.  Women have a wonderful instinct about things.
    They can discover everything except the obvious.</p>
    
    <h5 class= "SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN"> SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5> 
    <p class="speech"> Arthur, I couldn’t tell my wife.  When could I have
    told her?  Not last night.  It would have made a life-long separation
    between us, and I would have lost the love of the one woman in the world
    I worship, of the only woman who has ever stirred love within me.  Last
    night it would have been quite impossible.  She would have turned from me
    in horror . . . in horror and in contempt.</p>
    
    <h5 class="LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h5> 
     <p class= "speech">Is Lady Chiltern as perfect as all that?</p>
    
    <h5 class="SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5> 
    <p class="speech"> Yes; my wife is as perfect as all that.</p>
    
    <h5 class="LORD_GORING"> LORD GORING.</h5>  
    <p class="stage_directions">[Taking off his left-hand glove.]</p>
    <p class ="speech">What a pity!  I beg
    your pardon, my dear fellow, I didn’t quite mean that.  But if what you
    tell me is true, I should like to have a serious talk about life with
    Lady Chiltern.</p>
    
    <h5 class="SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5> 
     <p class ="speech">It would be quite useless.</p>
    
   <h5 class ="LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h5>
    <p class= "speech">  May I try?</p>
    
    <h5 class ="SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN"> SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>
     <p class ="speech" > Yes; but nothing could make her alter her views.</p>
    
    <h5 class ="LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h5>
    <p class ="Speech">  Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological
    experiment.</p>
    
     <h5 class ="SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5> 
      <p class="speech">All such experiments are terribly dangerous.</p>
    
   <h5 class ="LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h5> 
   <p class="speech">  Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow.  If it wasn’t so,
    life wouldn’t be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think
    you should have told her years ago.</p>
    
    <h5 class ="SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN" >SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>
     <p class="speech">  When?  When we were engaged?  Do you think she
    would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is
    such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that I had done
    a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable?</p>
    
    <h5 class="LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h5> 
    <p class="stage_directions ">  [Slowly.]</p>
     <p class ="speech">  Yes; most men would call it ugly names.  There
    is no doubt of that.</p>
    
    <h5 class="SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>
     <p class="stage_directions" > [Bitterly.]</p>
      <p class="speech">  Men who every day do something of
    the same kind themselves.  Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets
    in their own lives.</p>
    
   <h5 class ="LORD_GORING"> LORD GORING.</h5>
    <p class= "speech">That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other
    people’s secrets.  It distracts public attention from their own.</p>
    
    <h5 class ="SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN"> SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5> 
    <p class="speech"> And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did?  No
    one.</p>
    
    <h5 class ="LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h5> 
    <p class="stage_directions"> [Looking at him steadily.]</p> 
    <p class="speech">  Except yourself, Robert.</p>
    
    <h5 class ="SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>
     <p class="stage_directions">  [After a pause.]</p> 
     <p class="speech">  Of course I had private
    information about a certain transaction contemplated by the Government of
    the day, and I acted on it.  Private information is practically the
    source of every large modern fortune.</p>
    
    <h5 class ="LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h5>
     <p class="stage_directions">  [Tapping his boot with his cane.]</p>
      <p class="speech"> And public scandal
    invariably the result.</p>
    
    <h5 class="SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>
     <p class="stage_directions">  [Pacing up and down the room.]</p>
      <p class="speech">  Arthur, do you
    think that what I did nearly eighteen years ago should be brought up
    against me now?  Do you think it fair that a man’s whole career should be
    ruined for a fault done in one’s boyhood almost?  I was twenty-two at the
    time, and I had the double misfortune of being well-born and poor, two
    unforgiveable things nowadays.  Is it fair that the folly, the sin of
    one’s youth, if men choose to call it a sin, should wreck a life like
    mine, should place me in the pillory, should shatter all that I have
    worked for, all that I have built up.  Is it fair, Arthur?</p>
    
    <h5 class ="LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h5>
     <p class="speech"> Life is never fair, Robert.  And perhaps it is a good thing
    for most of us that it is not.</p>
