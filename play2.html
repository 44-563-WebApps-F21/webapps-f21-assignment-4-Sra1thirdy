 <h4> Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house
</h4>
<p>
    <h5 class="LORD_GORING"> LORD GORING.</h5> 
    <p class="speech">dressed in the height of fashion, _is lounging in an
    armchair_.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN is standing in front of the fireplace.
    He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress.
    As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room.</p>
    
    <h5 class="LORD_GORING"> LORD GORING. </h5> 
    <p class="speech"> My dear Robert, it’s a very awkward business, very awkward
    indeed.  You should have told your wife the whole thing.  Secrets from
    other people’s wives are a necessary luxury in modern life.  So, at
    least, I am always told at the club by people who are bald enough to know
    better.  But no man should have a secret from his own wife.  She
    invariably finds it out.  Women have a wonderful instinct about things.
    They can discover everything except the obvious.</p>
    
    <h5 class= "SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN"> SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5> 
    <p class="speech"> Arthur, I couldn’t tell my wife.  When could I have
    told her?  Not last night.  It would have made a life-long separation
    between us, and I would have lost the love of the one woman in the world
    I worship, of the only woman who has ever stirred love within me.  Last
    night it would have been quite impossible.  She would have turned from me
    in horror . . . in horror and in contempt.</p>
    
    <h5 class="LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h5> 
     <p class= "speech">Is Lady Chiltern as perfect as all that?</p>
    
    <h5 class="SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5> 
    <p class="speech"> Yes; my wife is as perfect as all that.</p>
    
    <h5 class="LORD_GORING"> LORD GORING.</h5>  
    <p class="stage_directions">[Taking off his left-hand glove.]</p>
    <p class ="speech">What a pity!  I beg
    your pardon, my dear fellow, I didn’t quite mean that.  But if what you
    tell me is true, I should like to have a serious talk about life with
    Lady Chiltern.</p>
    
    <h5 class="SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5> 
     <p class ="speech">It would be quite useless.</p>
    
   <h5 class ="LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h5>
    <p class= "speech">  May I try?</p>
